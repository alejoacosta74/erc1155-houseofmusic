## üåü Features

- **Decentralized Marketplace:** Seamlessly sell and purchase concert tickets in a trustless environment.
- **Ticket Lifecycle Management:** From minting fungible tokens representing tickets for sale to burning them upon purchase to issue non-fungible tickets to buyers, it's all managed here.
- **Empower Artists and Organizers:** With the specialized 'operator' role, get the exclusivity to mint new ticket tokens.
- **Transparency Ensured:** Built on Ethereum, every ticket transaction is verifiable.
- **Hybrid Data Management:** Leveraging both a decentralized blockchain for ticket data and a centralized database for ticket metadata, giving you the best of both worlds.

## Demo Guide üìñ

Dive into the two main functionalities of House of Music DApp:

### PART I: Sale Opening for a New Concert
As an operator, mint ERC-1155 fungible tokens representing tickets.

* The first part of the demo consist in minting a new ERC 1155 fungible token that represents a batch of tickets for a concert.
* This is done by using the 'operator' role.
* The 'operator' role is the only one that can mint new fungible tokens, and is also the owner of the deployed smart contract to Ethereum. 

#### 1. Open the marketplace on your browser
   
   The marketplace is accesible at http://localhost:3000

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

The `ganache` instance running on docker is known to have issues with the Metamask wallet and the nonce of transactions. 
If you encounter any issues using the Dapp, please consider running the Ganache Desktop locally on your machine.
You can install the Ganache GUI from https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart/
### Please bear in mind that if you choose to run Ganache locally, you would have to import the Ganache GUI private key into Metamask:
1. Open the Ganache GUI
2. Click the key icon under the ACCOUNTS tab, the pop-up screen will display the private key information for the preferred address selected as shown here:

5. Click Import Account
   
    <img src="doc/image-14.png" alt="Alt text" width="250"/>

6. Paste the private key into the text box and click Import
   
Dont forget to update the `.env` file with:
- the private key taken from the Ganache GUI
- the port of the local Ganache instance (i.e. 7545)
